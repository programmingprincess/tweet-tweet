Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. How to load a high quality image 
2. API troubleshooting

## Notes

I was unable to get the actual Twitter content to show up inside my table view cell. The content shows up on the console, but not on the actual app. The basic functionalities (logging in, authorizing, and logging out) works. I tried to implement the retweet and favorite functions, but was unable to test them because the labels did not show up.
